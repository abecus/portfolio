The Mandelbrot set is the set obtained from the recurrence relation, Z_(n) = Z²_(n-1) + c, where, Z_(0) = c. where c is a complex number” — Wolfram Mathworld.Mandelbrot set  created using python script The colors in a Mandelbrot set represents the iterations at which that complex number diverges to infinity (we can use here some threshold instead of infinity).",

      "Breadth-first search (BFS) is a common search technique on graphs. BFS is a companion of depth-first search (DFS). While DFS traverses the graph depth-wise, BFS does it breadth-wise. It’s used to find a node in a graph. It may also be used to get the path to that node from a given node or to just traverse all the nodes and edges in a graph.",
